# AffirME

![Streamlit Logo](https://github.com/rickyringler/Streamlit_Starter_Guide_with_Authentication/assets/135162902/b66d4fe6-d2fc-4bc0-869a-3dbdf428e214)

This repository exemplifies application development; consolidating data engineering principals and programming concepts into one portable, reliable application.

This repository is ideal for individuals interested in maintaining an application with minimal overhead and inputs.

This repository builds an application locally named "AffirME" and provides users with a GUI to generate daily affirmations, yoga poses, and philosophy quotes from multiple open-sourced APIs. This is critical, because full-scale projects often require several external APIs to function, and failing to provide an environment to process data and handle unexpected behavior will ultimately result in a crash. This project includes safeguards against external pitfalls.

This repository does not provide an explicit framework for self-starters such as a tutorial, and intermediate programming knowledge is assumed, so modification of the source code will be dependent on users' capacity - this is a no hand holding repository.

## Key Features

1. **User and Developer interfaces:** Lightweight and portable with Flask.
2. **Open API:** Push or pull data across platforms.
3. **Schedule Update::** Update the app with new data with Luigi.
