The goal of this project is to demonstrate competency with fundamental data engineering principles
and sustainable programming.

This project demonstrates comprehension in:

Application Development (Python, Flask, HTML, CSS)
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs, JSON)
Data Pipelines and Scheduling (Luigi)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Versioning Control Systems (Git)

Note: This probably isn't the most efficient structure for creating an app of this scale but this was definitely the most fun method ;)
