# AffirME

## Use Cases
This repository is ideal for individuals interested in learning basic application development with minimal overhead and inputs.

## Background
This repository builds an application locally named "AffirME" and provides users with a GUI to generate daily affirmations, yoga poses, and philosophy quotes from multiple open-sourced APIs. This is critical, because full-scale projects often require several external APIs to function, and failing to provide an environment to process data and handle unexpected behavior will ultimately result in a crash. This project includes safeguards against external pitfalls.

This repository does not provide an explicit framework for self-starters such as a tutorial, and intermediate programming knowledge is assumed, so modification of the source code will be dependent on users' capacity - this is a no hand holding repository.
