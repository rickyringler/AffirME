# AffirME
Application for wellbeing prompting daily affirmations, philosophy quotes, and yoga poses.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate competency with fundamental data engineering principles
and programming concepts.

This project demonstrates comprehension in:

Application Development (Python, Flask, HTML, CSS)
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs, JSON)
Data Pipelines and Scheduling (Luigi)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Versioning Control Systems (Git)

Note: This probably isn't the most efficient structure for creating an app of this scale but this was definitely the most fun method ;)
